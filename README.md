- I made this project using Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and Zod.
- I kept it modular with separate DTO interfaces and a separate service layer.
- I used learning from my previous projects to keep structure clean and practical.
- Project includes input validation, error handling, and throttling (rate limiting).
- I have added gracefull shutdown on SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
